    "**To the Coder LLM:**\n",
    "You are an expert Python developer specializing in FastAPI and AI applications. Your task is to implement the backend logic for a sophisticated chatbot feature for a smart journaling application using a **single, unified endpoint**. The chatbot acts as an \"Elaboration Coach\" to help enrich writing and as a \"Compassionate Listener\" for follow-up conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the following detailed specification to generate the Python code. The primary framework is **FastAPI** to handle the request and langchain to handle the interaction with the LLM. LLM used is openAI model. All history (journal drafts, chat messages) is stored on the backend with the help of langchain, associated with a `uuid`.\n",

    "* **Persona: \"The Compassionate Listener & Elaboration Coach\"**.\n",
    "    * **Tone:** Gentle, curious, validating, and supportive.\n",
    "    * **Core Directives:** It never gives advice. It asks open-ended questions. It uses the journal's context to be relevant. It preserves the user's original voice.\n",

    "    * **A) IF `journal_data` has content (covers user actions 1, 2, and 4):**\n",
    "        * This is the priority action. The user has written or edited their journal.\n",
    "        * Update the session history with the new `journal_data.text`.\n",
    "        * Execute the **\"Elaboration Coach\"** logic on the new text.\n",
    "        * Generate an `elaboration_suggestion` (or `null` if the entry is complete).\n",
    "        * Construct the response with the `elaboration_suggestion` and `assistant_response: null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **B) ELSE IF `user_chat_input` has content (covers user action 3):**\n",

    "        * Construct the response with the `assistant_response` and `elaboration_suggestion: null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Save the updated session history (new text and/or new chat messages) back to the state store associated with the `uuid`.\n",
